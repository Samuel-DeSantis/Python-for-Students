## Learning to Program!

Programming is a great way to complement problem solving skills learned in different subject areas, such as math and science. Taking what is learned in those classes and applying them in such a ways that allows for the visualization and further engagment of the various ideas and theory helps to reinforce what is being taught.

Simply put, a program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. These lessons use the Python programming language for two main reasons:

1. Readability
2. Scalability

Python is a very readable language. It's syntax easy relatively close to writing phrases in english so it makes it a bit more approachable for a beginner. It is also a rather easy programming language to learn since it is easy to read and there is also a large community behind it that is great at answering questions and giving assistance. Python is also very powerful and can scale as the student grows and learns more. Moving from elementary topics to more advanced ones, Python is a valuable tool that can help with schooling and can possibly lead to potential jobs in the future.

There are a couple approaches I would recommend for working through the following lessons. See below:
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Google Colab is an online platform that allows you to write and execute programs on the web browser. It may be the easiest route for those new to progrmaming. PyCharm is a great IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for working with Python. It is widely used by Python developers and is a great platform as well for people who may want to dive into Python more at some point. VSCode is a code editor that is chalked full of other tools and works well with basically any language. This option may be a little more difficult for those to setup who have no experience with programming or setting up environments. Beginners may want to start with one of the former and try VSCode once they advance a bit more with programming.

I am writing this assuming that Google Colab is the platform being used, 

## Variables and Types

| Section Lessons |

| [lesson_2](###lesson_2) | Variables and Types     |
| [lesson_3](###lesson_3) | Using Variables & Types |

Before we dive right in, it's customary to start a new programming by writing a "Hello World" program. To do that, write `print("Hello World")` and hit CTRL+ENTER and it will run the program.
