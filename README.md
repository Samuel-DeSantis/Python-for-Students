## Learning to Program

The following are some answers to questions you may have before getting started with some of the lessons.

### Why learn to program?

Programming is a great way to complement problem solving skills learned in subject areas, such as math and science. Applying what is learned in class allows for greater visualization and further engagment of ideas and theory to help reinforce what is being taught. Programming is also a great skill that helps develop better problem solving skills and will help if the student wishes to pursue secondary education.

### What is programming?

At a basic level, a program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Coding is the practice of writing the code that the machine runs to do the task and programming is the problem solving that goes into coming up to a solution that one wishes to solve.

### Why Python?

These lessons use the Python programming language for two main reasons:

1. Readability
2. Scalability

Python is a very readable language. It's syntax is relatively close to writing phrases in English so it makes it a bit more approachable for a beginner. It is also has a large community behind it that is great at answering questions and giving assistance. Python is also very powerful and can scale as the student grows and learns more. Moving from elementary topics to more advanced ones, Python is a valuable tool that can help with schooling and can possibly lead to potential jobs in the future.

There are a couple approaches I would recommend for working through the following lessons. See below:
- [PyCharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) <=recommended
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Google Colab is an online platform that allows you to write and execute programs on the web browser. It may be the easiest route for those new to programming, but the slight learning curve with the others will be very beneficial for future use. PyCharm is a great IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for working with Python. It is widely used by Python developers and beginners alike. VSCode is a code editor that is chalked full of other tools and works well with basically any language. This option may be a little more difficult for those to setup who have no experience with programming or setting up environments. Beginners may want to start with one of the former and try VSCode once they advance a bit more with programming.

### Getting Setup

I am writing this with the use of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) in mind. Pycharm is easy to install, use, and will be a good introduction to the programming environment. Please follow the instructions below to get PyCharm setup with the GitHub repo you are currently reading from.

1. Start PyCharm, see menu with => 'New Project', 'Open', and 'Get from VCS'. We will use 'Get from VCS' shortly.
2. Go to [Python-for-Students](https://github.com/Samuel-DeSantis/Python-for-Students), if not there already, and click the GREEN "Code" dropdown button, select "HTTPS" and click the copy button.
3. PyCharm > "Get from VCS" > Paste the copied GitHub info into URL, then hit "Clone" and "Trust Project.

## Variables and Types

The following table outlines what will be covered in the lessons for this

|   Name   |       Description       |
|----------|-------------------------|
| [lesson_1](###lesson_1) | Learning with Lessons   |
| [lesson_2](###lesson_2) | Variables and Types     |
| [lesson_3](###lesson_3) | Using Variables & Types |

Before we dive right in, it's customary to start a new programming by writing a "Hello World" program. To do that, write `print("Hello World")` and hit CTRL+ENTER and it will run the program.
